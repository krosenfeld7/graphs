# graphs
An attempt at a graph library with a number of types, operations and algorithms

Graph Types:
- Unweighted Directed/Undirected
- Weighted Directed/Undirected
- Multigraphs

Graph Formats:
- Custom graph classes
- Adjacency Lists
- Adjacency Matrices

Graph Operations:
- Add/remove vertices/edges (of course)
- Union
- Intersection
- Addition (Join)
- Subtraction (Difference)
- Equality / Inequality
- Conversions between graph types

These operations can only be performed on graphs of the same type.

Graph Algorithms:
- Cuts:
  - Bridge detection
  - Articulation point detection
- Cycles:
  - Cycles
  - Negative Cycles
  - Hamiltonian Cycles
- Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs):
  - Prims
  - Kruskals
  - Arborescence (Not yet implemented)
- Shortest Paths:
  - Dijkstras
  - Floyd Warshall
  - Bellman Ford
  - Johnsons
- Searches/Traversals:
  - Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
  - Topological Search

Please note that some of the files are missing comments, etc. I have considered adding comments all throughout, but I end up just wanting to rewrite most of the code as I see much better ways of implementing this now. However, I would rather spend the time on new projects that are more useful.
